## Roadmap - What's planned for version 1.0?

For version 1.0, the app aims to provide three core concepts.

1. You can create `teams`, making you the team's captain.
2. You can invite people as `members` to your `team`.
3. You can plan `events` where the `members` would then answer to.

Events should only be visible to people in the respective team, thus automatically nominated via team.

If time allows it, the cumulation of teams into one or multiple divisions would be amazing.
E.g. if a soccer team has multiple teams (1st league, 2nd league, children's teams, etc.) handling them as a division that allows administrating multiple teams is much better than having to circle around multiple teams one by one.
